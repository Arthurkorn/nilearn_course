Installation Notes
------------------

Please follow the nilearn installation notes:
http://nilearn.github.io/introduction.html#installation

**At telecom**: use the local install of anaconda:

     export PATH=/cal/softs/anaconda/anaconda-2.0.1/bin/:$PATH


Reading the training materials
-------------------------------

### With the IPython notebook

The recommended way to access the materials is to execute them in the
IPython notebook. If you have the IPython notebook installed, you should
download the materials (see below), go the the `notebooks` directory, and
launch IPython notebook from there by typing:

    cd notebooks
    ipython notebook

in your terminal window. This will open a notebook panel load in your web
browser.

### On Internet

If you don't have the IPython notebook installed, you can browse the
files on Internet:
